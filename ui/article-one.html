                I saw two puppies fighting today......
Don't know for what...
They might be fighting for fun....
Or might be for something else....

One thing was for sure...
They were enjoying for sure....
This reminded me you my brother...
The fun we had....

I m missing you for sure...
We will met...
But the fun will not...
Hope i was a child...
Hope you were a child...

But i m sittng in your collage remembering you....
Hope you will also....
I wish we can have the same fun again.....

Time is grt... 
Dat's i believe now..
But nothing is greater than you...
Dat's what i m confirm about...
            </p>
            <h4>
            A word
            </h4>
            <p>
                i wrote 
a word ..
a word that meant a lot to me.. 
a world that was everything for me...
a place where i can dream...
a dream which i can live...
i guess the word ...

i asked everyone about it..
but no one ever tried to know...
a world that i was living in...
a dream that i was dreaming in...
i act like a wanderer... guessing the word..
in this limitless world...
trying to find the solution...
without knowing the question...
a word that meant a lot to me...
is gone...

i tried to find it everwhere....
it must have gone to some unforgettable place...
i wish i could find a way... 
a way that will dent the world...
the word is gone ... 
i wish i can guess it...
